# System Design

### [HiredinTech](https://www.hiredintech.com/courses/system-design) system design process:

> * defining use cases and constraints

> * abstract design, state clear the blocks and component in the system

> * check the bottlenecks in the design, if need load balancer, many machines to handle requests, distribute database to multiple machines, or in-memory caching to improve process speed

> * scalability
